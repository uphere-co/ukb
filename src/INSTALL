ukb needs boost version 1.48 or higher to compile. Specifically, You need the
following Boost libraries:

      * boost graph library
      * boost program options 
      * boost filesystem
      * boost tokenizer
      * boost lexical cast
      * boost numeric conversions
      * boost timer
	  * boost asio

if you need to compile the boost libraries yourself, you should to call the
'bootstrap.sh' script and then use b2 with the --layout=system option. 

% ./bootstrap.sh
% ./b2 install --layout=system

If you have boost properly installed, just run by the standard compilation
procedure:

# Check dependencies and generate Makefile

% ./configure 

# the ./configure script has some options (./configure --help to see them
# all). The important options are:
#
#  --prefix
#             path were the executables will be installed (after 'make
#             install')
#
#  --with-boost-include
#            path were the Boost include files reside (default is
#            /usr/include)
#
#  --with-boost-lib
#            path were the Boost library files reside (default is /usr/lib)
#
#  --enable-static
#            Enable static linkage

# Compile 

% make

# The executables are now in the current directory. Now, if you want
# to install them on a different location (set by the --prefix option
# of ./configure), just 'cp' them, or execute

% make install

* Installing a custom version of boost, and compiling against it

Say I want to install boot version 1.49 in /opt/boost1.49 and compile ukb
against it. Do the following:

(download boost and uncompress in $boost_dir)
% cd $boost_dir
% ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/opt/boost1.49
% ./b2 install --layout=system
% sudo ./b2 install --layout=system

then go to ukb's "src" directory and do the following:

% ./configure --with-boost-lib=/opt/boost1.49/lib --with-boost-include=/opt/boost1.49/include
% make

for running ukb, you have to include the boost lib directory inside
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (in MacOS, the variable name is "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH") , e.g.:

% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}/opt/boost1.49/lib

and then run ukb as usual.
